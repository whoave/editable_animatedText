# editable_animatedText
animatedtext Javascript small function

It has 3 versions of animated writing effect with pure javascript.
The first version is working with 2 textboxes and a button. It gets the values from textboxes and converts them into writing effect.
Other two are strict, doesn't have any editable forms. One for manually coding a animated writing text effect and other one('broken one') is same too but it starts to do strange things after first loop.
